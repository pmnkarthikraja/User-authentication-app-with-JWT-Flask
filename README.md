# User-authentication-app-with-JWT-Flask
User Authentication Application with JWT module by using Flask-Python 
Main Features of this web application:
      --> User can login by their Email ID and Password
      --> User can Register by using their Firstname,lastname,DOB,Email and Password
      --> User can Reset Password when user loggedin in the application
      --> User can choose Forgot Password with their Email ID, application will authenticate the user and send the OTP to their Email ID for verification (Only if user             is registered)
      --> Session login by JWT module with Token generated by JWT, for Session, application using 'Flask session'. So, once the user loggedin, and user don't need to               loggedin again if user closed the browser and re opened the server.
      --> User passwords are saved as encryption method (sha256 algorithm)
      
 
Ways to Access the web application:
  ---> Install the requirements by 'pip'.
  ---> Create Directory.
      --> Master directory: User_authentication 
            --> Sub directory: static, templates, app.py(main file)
  ---> Create MySQL Database
       ---> Here I used MySQL Database.
  ---> Configure MySQL.connector in flask main file --> app.py
       --> Host: Localhost
       --> User: root
       --> Password: root!@#123
       --> Database: userlogin
       --> Auth_plugin: mysql_native_password
  ---> Start Flask Application (app.py)
       --> Application Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000/
       
Main aspects:
  ---> Password Encryption:
      --> Used package - werkzeug.security -> generate_password_hash algorithm.
      --> Using Algorithm : sha256:260000
  ---> User Authentication with JWT module (Jason Web Token)
      --> Used package - Flask-jwt-extended -> creating token for every user and It will expire
      --> Token consists three parts, i,e Header, Payload, Signature
      --> Using Algorithm : base64 encode 
      --> Advantage: --> User Authentication when automatically loggedIn based on verifying with generated token created by JWT during user login
  ---> Token Storage in Flask Session
      --> Flask Session is server side session to our application
      --> The data in the session is stored on the top of the cookies and signed by the server cryptographically
  ---> For sending email, the application using smptlib (built-in) package. Where user can give their own email for sending.
